# Patent Considerations – Biomimetic Inventions (Phyllux)

> This document is **informational only**. It does not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon as such. Any final patent strategy must be reviewed with qualified counsel.

## Intent

The inventor is exploring patent protection for certain underlying biomimetic concepts, particularly where:

- A common phyllotactic geometry (e.g., golden angle ~137.5°, 121-node layouts, position-index anchors) appears across multiple domains (antennas, neural interfaces, cryptography, and integrated systems).  
- Specific structural and algorithmic combinations are believed to be novel and non-obvious.

The code and diagrams in this repository are intentionally limited to **toy-level demonstrations** to keep room for future filings and trade secrets.

## Relationship to Public Repository

- This repository **may support prior art** by demonstrating concept-level ideas and dates of disclosure.  
- At the same time, **it omits** certain implementation details (e.g., manufacturing tolerances, process parameters, and full claim language) that may be better handled as trade secrets or through formal patent filings.  
- Any performance metrics mentioned in related documents (e.g., “X dB improvement”, “Y% reduction”, “Z× faster”) should be understood as **modelled or aspirational values** unless otherwise supported by published data.

## Potential Filing Themes (High-Level, Non-Exhaustive)

- Phyllotactic antenna arrays with golden-angle spacing and specific indexing schemes.  
- Neural electrode layouts using similar phyllotactic geometry for potential improvements in coverage or signal quality.  
- Cryptographic key generation or binding mechanisms based in part on geometric indexing.  
- Integrated devices or systems that use a shared geometry across multiple layers (sensing, communications, security).

Exact claim language and scope are intentionally **not** specified here.

## Recommended Caution for Users

- Do not assume that material here is “free to patent” simply because it is public. Depending on timing and jurisdiction, these disclosures may limit what can be patented by anyone.  
- Do not treat this file as proof that patents **have** been filed, granted, or will be granted. Status may change over time and must be checked independently.
