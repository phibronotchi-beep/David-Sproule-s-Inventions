# PhiKey – Overview (Public)

PhiKey is a conceptual cryptographic protocol inspired by irreversible geometric growth patterns.

Public ideas explored:
- Generate structured lattices using sequential growth rules.
- Traverse lattices to derive pseudo‑random sequences.
- Explore how geometric constraints might enhance security properties.

Intentionally high‑level; no full mechanism disclosed.
