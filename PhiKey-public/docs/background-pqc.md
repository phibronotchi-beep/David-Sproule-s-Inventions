# Post‑Quantum Cryptography Background (Public)

Post‑quantum cryptography (PQC) aims to protect against quantum attacks on classical schemes like RSA/ECDSA.

Lattice‑based approaches (e.g., NIST candidates) use hard math problems over discrete grids. PhiKey explores a geometric flavor of lattice ideas, but this repo shows only simplified, educational examples.
