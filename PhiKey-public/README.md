# PhiKey – Public Concept Repo (Geometric Security Protocol)

This repository presents a high-level, non‑proprietary overview of the **PhiKey** concept.

PhiKey explores lattice‑like, growth‑inspired structures for cryptographic key material, drawing inspiration from natural geometric patterns like phyllotaxis.

> ⚠️ **Conceptual only**. This repo contains **toy demos** and does **not** disclose the full PhiKey protocol, algorithms, or production implementation. Detailed specifications are maintained privately for potential patent protection.

## Goals (Public Repo)

- Educational demos of geometric lattice generation.
- Generic path‑traversal visualization (not a real cipher).
- Public reference for geometric cryptography concepts.

## What Is *Not* Here

- Full key generation algorithm.
- Encryption/decryption procedures.
- Security proofs or performance claims.
- Patent claim language.
