## Required Improvements for phyllux-inventions-wip

Per governance rules, the following improvements are **required**:

### 1. Lightweight Maturity Tags (Partial Implementation)

**Current State:**
- Some fusions have: `**Maturity:** Conceptual | Derived`
- Not all fusions may have consistent tags

**Required Tags (per governance):**
- Conceptual
- Derived
- Simulated
- Structural
- Candidate for Formalization

**Action Needed:**
- Audit all fusion READMEs for maturity tag consistency
- Ensure all fusions have appropriate maturity tags
- Document tag definitions if not already present

### 2. Explicit Image Role Labels (Missing)

**Current State:**
- Images have disclaimers (good)
- Images marked as "Placeholder" in captions
- No explicit role classification system

**Required Labels (per governance):**
- Concept Art
- Placeholder
- Structural Diagram

**Action Needed:**
- Add explicit image role labels to image captions or metadata
- Ensure consistency across all fusion pages

### 3. Exploratory Research Statement (Missing)

**Current State:**
- README.md has good disclaimers
- Individual fusion pages have image disclaimers
- No explicit statement about exploratory nature and formal embodiments

**Required Statement (per governance):**
> "This repository documents exploratory and generative research outputs. Formal embodiments are described separately in provisional or technical filings."

**Action Needed:**
- Add this statement to README.md (prominent location)
- Consider adding to ABOUT.md or creating dedicated section

## PPA Alignment Check

### Core Protected Elements (Confirmed Consistent)

✅ **Geometric Integration Method:**
- Golden angle: 137.508° (consistent across all repos)
- 121-node layouts (consistent)
- Position-index anchors (consistent)

✅ **Shared Phyllotactic Angular Parameter:**
- All code uses 137.508°
- Documentation references golden angle consistently

✅ **Non-Periodic Layout Advantages:**
- Framed as design goals, not guarantees
- Appropriate disclaimers present

### Repo Support for PPA (Confirmed)

✅ **biomimetic-inventions-public:**
- Supports PPA without competing
- Toy-level demonstrations preserve claim scope
- PPA disclaimer: "Simulation-based; empirical validation required per provisional application prepared for filing Jan 21, 2026"

✅ **phyllux-framework:**
- Governance only, no invention claims
- Supports ecosystem without narrowing scope

✅ **phyllux-inventions-wip:**
- Exploratory fusions support PPA
- No over-specific embodiments
- Maintains future claim scope

**Verdict:** ✅ **Well-aligned** - No misalignment detected

---

## Public Disclosure & Narrative Safety

### Language Consistency Check

✅ **biomimetic-inventions-public:**
- "Conceptual/educational only"
- "Toy demos only"
- "Not production-ready"
- Appropriate medical/security disclaimers

✅ **phyllux-framework:**
- Governance and licensing focus
- No product claims
- Ethical framework clearly stated

✅ **phyllux-inventions-wip:**
- "Research-stage"
- "Qualified language" (simulations suggest, designed to, potential for)
- Image disclaimers present
- ⚠️ Could benefit from explicit exploratory statement

**Verdict:** ✅ **Safe** - No "working product" implications detected

---

## Image & Visual Status

### biomimetic-inventions-public ✅
- All images reproducible from scripts
- Clean, white backgrounds
- No UI artifacts
- Saved to `/images/` directory
- Headless operation configured

### phyllux-framework ✅
- No images (governance only)
- No image replacement needed

### phyllux-inventions-wip ✅
- Images preserved (no deletion)
- DISCLAIMER.md present
- Placeholder labels in captions
- ⚠️ Could benefit from explicit role labels (Concept Art, Placeholder, Structural Diagram)

---

## Cross-Repository Consistency

### Terminology ✅
- "Phyllux" branding consistent
- "PhiKey" → "Phyllux Vault" transition documented
- Golden angle: 137.508° (consistent)

### Cross-Links ✅
- All repos link to each other correctly
- GitHub URLs verified
- Navigation paths functional

### Ethical IP Tiers ✅
- Consistent across repos
- 4-tier model documented
- Pioneer/Mission-Aligned/Commercial/Free

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- All repos maintain appropriate disclaimers
- No performance guarantees detected
- No "working product" language
- PPA alignment maintained

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **phyllux-inventions-wip** missing required improvements (maturity tags, image labels, exploratory statement)
- **Impact:** Low - these are additive improvements, not critical issues
- **Action:** Additive only, no deletion or replacement

### High Risk ❌
- **None detected**

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Required per Governance)

1. **phyllux-inventions-wip/README.md:**
   - Add explicit exploratory research statement
   - Ensure maturity tag taxonomy is documented

2. **phyllux-inventions-wip fusion pages:**
   - Audit maturity tags for consistency
   - Add explicit image role labels where missing

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create or update maturity tag definitions
   - Ensure image role classification is clear

### Future (Optional Improvements)

1. Consider creating `MATURITY_TAGS.md` in WIP repo
2. Consider creating `IMAGE_ROLES.md` in WIP repo
3. Consider cross-repo alignment audit process
