# Phyllux Ecosystem Spine

This document defines the invariant "method spine" and establishes how this repository relates to others in the Phyllux ecosystem.

**For the canonical spine document, see:** [phyllux-framework/PHYLUX_SPINE.md](https://github.com/phibronotchi-beep/phyllux-framework/blob/main/PHYLUX_SPINE.md)

## The Method Spine

The core invariant across all Phyllux repositories is:

**A geometric integration method using a shared phyllotactic angular parameter (137.508° golden angle) that provides non-periodic layout advantages.**

This spine:
- Is the protected core (may be subject to provisional patent application)
- Appears across multiple applications (neural interfaces, antennas, cryptography)
- Provides the unifying geometric principle
- Is not over-specified in public repositories (preserves future claim scope)

## This Repository's Role

**biomimetic-inventions-public** serves as canonical public prior art and reproducible demonstrations.

**Contains:**
- Prior art disclosures for Phyllux Mesh, Wave, Vault, Core
- Technical demonstrations
- Reproducible examples
- Geometry and method illustrations

**Relationship:** Demonstrates framework implementation, establishes prior art

## How Repositories Relate

### Without Contradiction

Repositories support each other without competing:

1. **Framework defines structure** → This repo uses it
2. **This repo establishes prior art** → Protects method spine
3. **WIP repo explores applications** → Generates new possibilities
4. **All reference the method spine** → Maintain consistency

### Maturity Progression

Content may progress through repositories:

1. **WIP repo:** Exploratory concept (Conceptual/Simulated)
2. **This repo (Public):** Prior art establishment (Structural/Candidate)
3. **Formal Filing:** Provisional patent application (if pursued)

### Linking Conventions

**Internal links (within repo):**
- Use relative paths: `[text](../path/to/file.md)`
- Verify links exist before committing

**Cross-repo links:**
- Use full GitHub URLs: `https://github.com/phibronotchi-beep/repo-name`
- Stable and accessible
- Appropriate for external references

**Canonical references:**
- Framework tier definitions: Link to `phyllux-framework/TEMPLATES/TEMPLATE_License_4Tier.md`
- Prior art strategy: Link to `phyllux-framework/phyllux-seed/prior-art-strategy.md`
- Disclosure framework: Link to `phyllux-framework/DISCLOSURE.md`

## Reproducible Figures

This repository emphasizes reproducibility:

- Images can be regenerated from scripts
- Scripts are documented and portable
- Outputs are verified in CI
- Reproducibility is a core value

## Consistency Requirements

### Terminology
- Use consistent tier names: Tier 1 (Pioneer), Tier 2 (Mission-Aligned), Tier 3 (Commercial), Tier 4 (Free)
- Use consistent maturity labels
- Use consistent image role labels

### Language
- Neutral, technical tone
- No hype or promotional language
- Appropriate disclaimers
- Research-stage language where applicable

### Claims
- No unqualified performance claims
- No absolute security guarantees
- No medical advice
- Exploratory language for theoretical work

## Future Freedom

The spine and repository structure are designed to:

- **Preserve future claim scope** - Don't over-specify in public repos
- **Enable research** - Open sharing of concepts and methods
- **Support formalization** - Repos support but don't compete with PPA
- **Maintain flexibility** - Structure allows evolution without breaking
