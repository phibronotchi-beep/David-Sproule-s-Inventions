# Phyllux Pitch

## Problem

- **Neural glitches**: Traditional electrode arrays suffer from crosstalk and poor coverage
- **Wireless limits**: Regular antenna arrays create grating lobes and coupling issues
- **Quantum threats**: Classical cryptography (RSA/ECC) vulnerable to quantum computers

## Solution

**Phyllux** — phyllotactic epicness for:
- **Crosstalk-free BCIs**: Phyllotactic neural meshing (PNM) with 30-50% crosstalk reduction
- **Wideband antennas**: Golden-angle fractal antenna arrays (GAFAA) with grating lobe suppression
- **Irreversible security**: Quantum-resistant cryptography using geometric lattice structures
- **Fusions for all domains**: Biological, AI/ML, medical, space, quantum extensions
