# Inventorship Declaration (Informal, Non-Legal)

> This declaration is provided for record-keeping and collaboration clarity within the Phyllux / biomimetic-inventions-public ecosystem. It does **not** replace formal patent-office declarations or assignments.

## Inventor

- **Name:** David Edward Sproule  
- **Location:** Edmonton, Alberta, Canada  
- **Role:** Independent inventor and sole author of the concepts and code currently present in this repository, except where third-party libraries, templates, or obvious boilerplate are used and credited.

## Subject Matter Covered (Informal Scope)

The following concept areas, as represented in this repository and related private work, are believed to originate from the inventor's own research and design efforts:

This is a **self-report by the inventor** and may not reflect the full legal picture. Questions of inventorship for any eventual patent filings must be determined under applicable law, potentially including contributions from collaborators or co-inventors in the future.

## Limitations

- This document does **not** assign rights, grant licenses, or serve as a contractual instrument.  
- It may be superseded, supplemented, or contradicted by later formal documents (e.g., patent applications, assignments, or collaboration agreements).  
- Anyone relying on this information for legal or contractual purposes should consult a qualified attorney.
