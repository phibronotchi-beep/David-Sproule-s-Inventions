# Note on Duplicate Files

This repository contains some files with similar names across different subdirectories (e.g., `3d_spiral_view.py`, `array_factor_polar.py`). These are **intentional duplicates** - each subdirectory (GAFAA, PhiKey, PNM) contains its own implementation tailored to that specific technology domain.

**Unifying under PPA embodiments:** All implementations are unified under the phyllotactic system principles per PPA "Phyllotactic Multi-Domain System for Neural Interfaces, Wireless Communications, and Cryptographic Security" filed Jan 21, 2026.

Files have been renamed to numbered lowercase-hyphenated format for standardization:
- GAFAA examples: 001-004
- PhiKey examples: 011-014  
- PNM examples: 021-024

Each maintains its domain-specific implementation while sharing the common phyllotactic geometric foundation.
