# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The biomimetic-inventions-public repository is actively maintained. Security updates are applied to the current version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email: phibronotchi@gmail.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Response Time

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment within 7 days.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- Repository scripts and automation tools
- Image generation scripts
- Documentation and structure
- Cross-repository references

**Note:** This policy does not cover vulnerabilities in the inventions themselves. Those should be reported separately.

## What We're Looking For

- Exposed API keys or credentials
- Security issues in scripts
- Vulnerabilities in automation tools
- Problems with cross-repository references

## What's Out of Scope

- General questions about inventions (use GitHub Discussions)
- Feature requests (use GitHub Issues)
- Licensing inquiries (contact phibronotchi@gmail.com)
