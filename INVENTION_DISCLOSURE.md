# Invention Disclosure (High-Level Summary)

> This disclosure is drafted in the style of an internal invention report. It is intentionally high level and should not be regarded as a complete patent specification or legal opinion.

## Inventor

- **Name:** David Edward Sproule  
- **Location:** Edmonton, Alberta, Canada

## Working Title

Phyllux Biomimetic Phyllotactic Architectures for Antennas, Neural Interfaces, Geometric Cryptography, and Integrated Systems

## Problem and Motivation (Summary)

1. **Neural Interfaces:**  
   - Existing electrode arrays may face challenges related to crosstalk, tissue response, and long-term stability.

2. **Antenna Arrays:**  
   - Conventional grids can exhibit undesirable sidelobes and mutual coupling in dense arrays.

3. **Cryptography:**  
   - Many schemes rely solely on algebraic structures and do not tie keys to physical geometries or layouts.

4. **System Integration:**  
   - Combining sensing, wireless, and security layers is often done piecemeal rather than via a single unifying design principle.

## Proposed Concept

Use **phyllotactic geometries**—particularly golden-angle spirals with 121-node (or similar) layouts and position-index anchors—as a **shared blueprint** across these domains:

- PNM: phyllotactic electrode meshes.  
- GAFAA / PhiWave: phyllotactic antenna arrays.  
- PhiKey: geometric keying based partly on indices derived from the geometry.  
- IBS / PhiNexus: an integrated architecture that uses the same geometry across neural, RF, and crypto layers.

The key idea is not simply that spirals exist in each domain, but that **one mathematical pattern is reused deliberately** for co-design.

## Status and Validation

- Current materials are primarily **design documents, toy examples, and conceptual simulations**.  
- No formal clinical trials, regulatory submissions, or cryptographic standards processes have been completed at this stage.  
- The inventor anticipates future simulation, prototyping, and testing, subject to resources and legal advice.

## Confidentiality and Publication

- This file appears in a **public GitHub repository**; therefore, it must be treated as a public disclosure, which can affect patent timelines and strategies.  
- Certain more detailed embodiments, if any, may be maintained separately and not disclosed here.

Anyone considering reliance on this disclosure for patent, licensing, or freedom-to-operate analyses should obtain professional guidance.
