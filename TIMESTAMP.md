# Timing and Disclosure Log – Biomimetic Inventions (Phyllux)

This file provides a **non-exhaustive timeline** of key activities related to the biomimetic concepts in this repository. It is intended as a convenient record, not as a formal legal instrument.

## Selected Milestones (Illustrative)

- **Late 2024 – 2025:**  
  - Initial concept development for phyllotactic arrays and related components.  
  - Private notes, simulations, and prototypes not necessarily captured here.

- **Early 2025 / 2026:**  
  - First public descriptions of the concepts via social media posts and GitHub commits.  
  - Creation and population of this repository with conceptual demos and documents.

- **January 2026:**  
  - Consolidation of documents under the **Phyllux** brand.  
  - Introduction of prior-art and patent-consideration files (`PRIOR_ART.md`, `PATENTS.md`, etc.).  
  - Active work on patent strategy and funding plans in separate IP-focused documents.

*Exact dates and legal effects of each disclosure depend on jurisdiction, repository history, and other factors outside the scope of this file.*

## Purpose of This File

- To help the inventor and collaborators keep track of **rough timing** for key events.  
- To support conversations with patent counsel by providing a starting point for reconstructing disclosure history.  
- To remind readers that this repository is not a static snapshot: documents evolve over time.

## Limitations

- This log may be incomplete, approximate, or superseded by more detailed records (e.g., commit histories, formal docketing systems, or external archives).  
- It does not determine any legal rights on its own. Only courts and patent offices can determine the final effect of any disclosure.
