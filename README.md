# Biomimetic Inventions – Public Demos

> Rebrand note: This material was originally written using the name **Solaris** for the underlying framework. As of January 20, 2026, the public-facing brand is **Phyllux** to better reflect its roots in phyllotaxis and light, and to avoid potential conflicts with existing software trademarks. Earlier mentions of “Solaris” are preserved in commit history and historical text to maintain prior-art continuity from the January 2, 2026 X disclosure and the January 7/14, 2026 GitHub commits.

Discover an innovative portfolio of phyllotaxis-inspired engineering marvels, where nature's elegant patterns meet cutting-edge technology. This repository showcases public demos of biomimetic inventions that harness the golden ratio and spiral arrangements found in plants, animals, and natural phenomena to solve real-world challenges in antennas, security, and neural interfaces.

## What is Biomimicry?

Biomimicry is the art and science of imitating nature's proven designs to create sustainable, efficient solutions. Think of how sunflowers optimize seed packing or how pinecones follow the golden angle—these principles fuel the inventions here!

## Featured Projects

### Golden-Angle Fractal Antenna Array (GAFAA)

Explore toy demos demonstrating phyllotactic spiral layouts for advanced antenna designs, optimizing signal distribution and efficiency inspired by nature's fractal patterns.

## About the Inventor

**David Edward Sproule** – An Edmonton-based independent inventor passionate about bridging biology and engineering. This is currently a solo project, with all development handled independently. By translating natural patterns like phyllotaxis and the golden angle, these concepts push boundaries in neural interfaces, antennas, and cryptography.
