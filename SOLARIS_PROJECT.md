# THE PHYLLUX PROJECT  
## A Shared-Innovation Model for Human Flourishing

> Rebrand note: This vision was originally written under the name “Solaris Project”. To avoid confusion with existing software and to better reflect the focus on phyllotaxis and light, the public-facing name is now **Phyllux Project**. Historical references to “Solaris” are kept in Git history and prior-art records for continuity.

> Important: This is a **vision and licensing philosophy document**. It mixes personal narrative, rough business thinking, and speculative applications. Nothing here is a guarantee of performance, revenue, regulatory approval, or future events.

Like a sunflower turning toward the sun,
Every seed arranged in spirals of golden light,
Each contributing to the whole,
None competing, all thriving—
This is how we build the future.

## The Vision

**Inventor:** David Edward Sproule  
**Location:** Edmonton, Alberta, Canada  
**Email:** phibronotchi@gmail.com  
**Date (original draft):** January 13, 2026

This document sketches a model of technological development where:

- Innovation serves human wellbeing first.  
- Contributors are treated fairly.  
- Pioneers who take real risks can be rewarded.  
- Knowledge flows widely for research and education.  
- Aggressive, extractive behavior is discouraged.

The Phyllux Project is the umbrella name for a family of biomimetic concepts (PNM, GAFAA/PhiWave, PhiKey, IBS/PhiNexus) and a proposed **tiered licensing framework** around them.

## Gifts and Licensing Philosophy

### High-Level Intent

The core ideas are:

- Certain organizations that are strongly aligned with the long-term flourishing of humanity may be offered **very favorable terms** (sometimes approaching “gift” status).  
- Mission-aligned organizations can access the technology on **reasonable, negotiable terms**.  
- Purely commercial users can license the technology on more conventional commercial terms.  
- Researchers, students, and hobbyists can explore and learn from the concepts **for free**, within a non-commercial scope.

All of this is subject to:

- Legal viability and timing of any patent filings.  
- The inventor’s evolving circumstances.  
- Future advice from qualified counsel.

### Tiered Licensing (Conceptual)

These tiers are **illustrative** and may change as the project matures.

#### Tier 1 – Pioneer Tier (Flagship Partners)

- Intended for a small number of organizations whose work is deeply aligned with the inventor’s goals (e.g., advanced BCI, sustainable energy, multiplanetary infrastructure).  
- Possible features:
  - Favourable up-front terms to support rapid deployment.  
  - Reduced or zero ongoing royalties in exchange for early support, help with patent costs, and meaningful collaboration.  
  - Optional technical consultation by the inventor.

The idea is to trade **acceleration and impact** for **fair but not maximized compensation**, not to lock anyone into rigid promises.

#### Tier 2 – Mission-Aligned Tier

- Intended for organizations working on:
  - Medical devices that reduce suffering.  
  - Scientific research advancing open knowledge.  
  - Infrastructure that connects underserved populations.  
- Possible features:
  - Modest license fees and/or low royalties.  
  - Expectation of good-faith collaboration, sharing of improvements where possible, and responsible deployment.  

Terms are negotiated case by case, depending on resources and mission fit.

#### Tier 3 – Commercial Tier

- Intended for for‑profit entities using the concepts primarily to generate revenue.  
- Possible features:
  - More conventional licensing (up-front fee + royalty, or other structures).  
  - Clear contractual boundaries around use, sublicensing, and IP enforcement.  

This tier recognises that **commercial users can fund ongoing R&D and IP maintenance** through fair compensation.

#### Tier 4 – Free / Research / Personal Tier

- Intended for:
  - Individual researchers and students.  
  - Universities and non-profit labs (non-commercial projects).  
  - Hobbyists and makers exploring the geometry and toy code.  
- Features:
  - No license fee or royalty for non-commercial use.  
  - Expectation of attribution where reasonable.  
  - Encouragement (not obligation) to share findings and improvements.

This tier is meant to keep the **knowledge layer as open as possible** without undermining the ability to sustain more advanced work.

## Technologies in Scope (Conceptual Overview)

The licensing model applies to a set of related biomimetic concepts:

1. **PNM – Phyllotactic Neural Meshing**  
   - Neural electrode layout concepts using golden‑angle, phyllotactic patterns.  
   - Intended design goals: dense coverage, potential for improved signal characteristics.  
   - Current status: conceptual and simulation-level work; not a medical device.

2. **GAFAA / PhiWave – Golden-Angle Antenna Arrays**  
   - Antenna element placements inspired by sunflower spirals.  
   - Intended design goals: favourable sidelobe and coupling behaviour, scalable arrays.  
   - Current status: conceptual and simulation-level; not a certified RF product.

3. **PhiKey – Geometric Security Concepts**  
   - Cryptographic design ideas that incorporate geometric indexing.  
   - Intended design goals: post‑quantum resilience and potential hardware binding.  
   - Current status: research-stage concepts and toy implementations; not production crypto.

4. **IBS / PhiNexus – Integrated Biomimetic System**  
   - Concept of a shared geometric architecture across neural, RF, and security layers.  
   - Intended design goals: system-level simplification and potential power/complexity benefits.  
   - Current status: system-level concept document.

Any performance numbers, timelines, or market sizes mentioned in earlier drafts should be treated as **illustrative targets or rough sketches**, not as validated results.

## Collaboration Process (Simplified)

The practical workflow for anyone seriously considering use of these ideas is:

1. **Understand the Scope**  
   - Review the public docs in this repository (`README.md`, `INTEGRATED_SYSTEM.md`, `PRIOR_ART.md`, etc.).  
   - Where appropriate, request more detail under NDA and with legal counsel involved.

2. **Classify Your Use Case**  
   - Non-commercial research or personal exploration → likely fits Tier 4.  
   - Mission-driven organization with clear public benefit → potential Tier 2.  
   - Commercial use in a revenue-generating product → Tier 3 or a custom structure.  
   - Deep strategic partner / flagship → possible Tier 1 discussion.

3. **Discuss Terms**  
   - Contact: **phibronotchi@gmail.com**  
   - Provide:
     - A brief description of your organization and mission.  
     - The intended application and which components (PNM, GAFAA, PhiKey, IBS) are relevant.  
     - Any constraints (timelines, budgets, regulatory requirements).

4. **Negotiate a Fair Agreement**  
   - Keep the agreement as concise as possible while covering:
     - Scope of license.  
     - Fees and/or royalties (if any).  
     - Support or consultation.  
     - Treatment of improvements.  
     - IP and enforcement posture.

5. **Build, Validate, Iterate**  
   - Run your own simulations, trials, and regulatory evaluations.  
   - Treat all conceptual materials here as a **starting point**, not as a drop‑in product design.

## Ethical Commitments (Non-Binding Norms)

The original Solaris text included a lot of informal language about “not being a jerk” and “no hoarding”. The structured, cleaned-up version is:

1. **Fair Dealing**  
   - Compensate fairly when using others’ work at commercial scale.  
   - Avoid exploitative contracts or one‑sided interpretations of ambiguous clauses.

2. **Transparency and Safety**  
   - Be honest about capabilities and limitations.  
   - Disclose safety issues, vulnerabilities, or failures promptly when appropriate.

3. **Shared Prosperity Where Possible**  
   - When your use of these ideas becomes highly successful, consider ways to support further research, open documentation, and community tools.

4. **Responsible Deployment**  
   - Aim to use these technologies in ways that reduce harm and increase human flourishing, especially for medical, surveillance, or defense-related applications.

These are **values statements**, not legal obligations, but they inform how the inventor prefers to choose partners and negotiate terms.

## Money, Patents, and Reality

This project exists at the intersection of:

- Aspirational technology (what might be possible with sustained work).  
- Real financial constraints (patent filing and prosecution costs, living expenses, health).  
- Evolving IP strategy (which parts to patent, which to publish, which to keep as trade secrets).

Key points:

- Filing and maintaining serious patent portfolios is expensive; any large-scale commercial use should expect to participate in that cost one way or another.  
- The inventor is not seeking maximal extraction; the goal is **sustainable invention**, not “win at all costs”.  
- This document and this repository do **not** guarantee that patents have been filed, granted, or will be granted. Patent status is time‑dependent and jurisdiction‑specific.

Anyone making material business decisions should **consult their own counsel** and treat this text as context, not an authoritative source of law or guarantees.
