---

### Step 4: NEGOTIATE FAIR TERMS

**This is a conversation, not a demand.** I want you to succeed. If the standard tier terms don't work for you, let's talk.

**Factors I consider:**
- Your mission (helping humanity = better terms)
- Your resources (startups get better terms than mega-corps)
- Your contribution (help with patents = reduces license fee)
- Your values (fair play and shared prosperity = I want to work with you)

**Factors I don't care about:**
- How much you can extract from me (I won't be bullied)
- Whether you're "important" (everyone's important if they're doing good work)
- Prestige (I don't need my name in lights, but I do need to eat)

---

### Step 5: FORMALIZE AGREEMENT

**We'll create a simple agreement that covers:**

1. **Scope:** Which technologies you're licensing
2. **Terms:** License fee, royalty (if any), payment schedule

5. **Improvements:** How we share enhancements (if applicable)
6. **Attribution:** How you'll credit me (if at all)
7. **Community:** Your commitment to fair play and shared prosperity

**This can be 2-3 pages, not 50.** We're humans making an agreement, not lawyers playing gotcha.

---

### Step 6: BUILD & PROSPER

**You get to work**, I get fair compensation, humanity gets amazing products.

**You're encouraged to:**
- ✅ Improve the technology (make it better!)
- ✅ Share improvements with community (Tier 2 requirement, Tier 3 optional but appreciated)
- ✅ Help others integrate it (rising tide lifts all boats)
- ✅ Defend against patent trolls (we're stronger together)

**You're forbidden from:**
- ❌ Being a greedy douchebag (hoarding, price gouging)
- ❌ Blocking others (you don't get exclusivity unless we explicitly agree)
- ❌ Patent trolling (using my tech offensively against community)
- ❌ Exploiting the inventor (I helped you, don't screw me)

---

### Step 7: CONTRIBUTE BACK

**If you're Tier 2 (mission-aligned), you committed to contribution:**

**Ways you can contribute:**
1. **Patent defense fund:** Contribute to collective legal defense against trolls
2. **Improvements:** Share your enhancements with community
3. **Documentation:** Write tutorials, guides, case studies
4. **Mentorship:** Help smaller teams integrate the technology

---

## ⚖️ THE ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

### The Rules of the Solaris Community

**If you use these technologies, you agree to:**

---

### Rule 1: DON'T BE A DOUCHEBAG

**What this means:**
- Don't exploit the inventor (I gave you something valuable, compensate fairly)
- Don't exploit customers (price fairly, don't gouge)
- Don't exploit workers (pay well, treat kindly)
- Don't exploit the planet (sustainability matters)

**Enforcement:**
- Community reputation (douchebags get called out)
- License termination (I can revoke your license for bad faith)
- Legal action (if you violate agreement, I'll sue)

---

### Rule 2: SHARE PROSPERITY

**What this means:**
- As you succeed, the inventor should prosper too (increase royalties if fair)
- Share improvements with community (Tier 2 requirement)
- Help newcomers (mentor, document, teach)
- Defend the community (against trolls, bad actors)

**This is a network, not a hierarchy.** Everyone contributes, everyone benefits.

---

### Rule 3: ADVANCE HUMANITY

**What this means:**
- Your products should make the world BETTER, not worse
- Medical devices save lives (not just extract profit from suffering)
- Communication tech connects people (not isolates them)
- Security tech protects people (not surveils them)
- AI systems align with human values (not manipulate or control)

**I'm giving you powerful tools.** Use them for good.

---

### Rule 4: BE TRANSPARENT

**What this means:**
- If you use this tech, say so (attribution appreciated)
- If something goes wrong, disclose it (safety first)
- If you can't follow the rules, talk to me (we'll work it out)

**Honesty builds trust. Trust builds community.**

---

### Rule 5: PROTECT THE COMMONS

**What this means:**
- Don't patent-block others (no exclusive claims on core technologies)
- Don't hoard knowledge (share what you learn)
- Don't weaponize IP (no offensive patent litigation against community)
- Defend against trolls (we fight together)

**This is a commons, not a kingdom.** No fences, no walls.

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS MODEL WORKS

### The Traditional System Is Broken

**Problems with the current IP system:**

1. **Inventors starve while lawyers feast**
   - $60K-$130K just to FILE patents
   - $100K-$1M to defend against trolls
   - Individual inventors can't afford this

2. **Innovation gets locked away**
   - Patents hide technology for 20 years
   - Competitors can't build on your work
   - Progress slows to a crawl

3. **Patent trolls parasitize creators**
   - Buy patents, don't build products
   - Sue everyone, produce nothing
   - Extract billions from actual innovators

4. **Greed replaces collaboration**
   - Companies hoard IP defensively
   - Licensing negotiations take years
   - Everyone loses except lawyers

**There has to be a better way.**

---

### The Solaris Model Fixes This

**How this model is different:**

1. **Inventor gets fair compensation, not maximum extraction**
   - I can live, continue inventing, fund patents
   - You get amazing tech without bankruptcy
   - Win-win instead of zero-sum

2. **Innovation flows freely to those who will use it well**
   - Tier 4 (free) for education and personal use
   - Tier 2 (mission-aligned) for those helping humanity
   - Tier 1 (pioneer) for those risking everything to change the world
   - Tier 3 (commercial) for those seeking profit

3. **Community defense against trolls**
   - We pool resources to defend patents
   - Attack on one is attack on all
   - Trolls face united front, not isolated victims

4. **Shared prosperity replaces greed**
   - You succeed → I prosper → I invent more → you get improvements
   - Virtuous cycle instead of exploitation
   - Everyone wins (except douchebags)

---

### Why Elon's Companies Get the Best Deal

**People might ask:** "Why does Elon get preferential terms? Isn't that unfair?"

**Answer:** No. Here's why:

1. **Risk vs. Reward**
   - SpaceX risks billions to make humanity multiplanetary
   - Tesla bet everything on electric vehicles when everyone said it was impossible
   - Neuralink is doing what no one thought possible with BCIs
   - They EARNED preferential treatment through audacity and risk

2. **Mission Alignment**
   - Their goals align with mine: advance humanity, not just make profit
   - I WANT them to succeed because their success benefits everyone
   - Helping them IS helping humanity

3. **Scale of Impact**
   - If Neuralink uses PNM, millions of paralyzed people could benefit
   - If SpaceX uses GAFAA, Mars colonization accelerates
   - If Tesla uses these techs, sustainable transport arrives faster
   - Their success multiplies my impact beyond what I could do alone

4. **Fair Exchange**
   - I'm asking for fair compensation, not maximum profit
   - $100K-500K + patent help is TINY compared to the value I'm providing
   - They get millions in R&D acceleration, I get security and purpose
   - This is an insanely good deal for them AND for me

**If you disagree, that's fine.** Build your own technologies and set your own terms. This is MY invention and MY choice of how to license it.

## 💰 ABOUT MONEY & FAIRNESS

### What "Fair Compensation" Means

**I'm not asking for billions.** I'm asking for:

1. **Security:** Enough to file patents ($60K-130K), live modestly, get medical care
2. **Recognition:** Credit for my contribution (not required, but appreciated)
3. **Purpose:** Opportunity to keep contributing to missions I believe in
4. **Dignity:** Not having to beg or grovel for what I've earned

**For Tier 1 (Elon's companies):**
- One-time: $100K-500K (covers 5-10 years of living expenses + patents)
- Ongoing: $0 royalties (it's a gift)
- Non-monetary: Help with patents, possible collaboration opportunity

**For Tier 2 (mission-aligned):**
- License fee: $10K-100K (negotiable based on resources)
- Royalty: 1-3% (scales with your success)
- Contribution: Help with patents, share improvements, defend community

**For Tier 3 (commercial):**
- License fee: $100K-1M (based on company size)
- Royalty: 3-5% (fair compensation for valuable IP)
- No contribution required (but appreciated if you want to help community)

**For Tier 4 (free tier):**
- $0 forever
- Just cite me and share knowledge

### Why This Isn't Greed

**Some might say:** "You're asking for hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's greedy."

**Response:** Let's do the math.

**What companies SAVE by using my technologies:**

| If Neuralink builds PNM from scratch | Cost |
|--------------------------------------|------|
| R&D team (5 engineers × 2 years) | $2M |
| Prototype fabrication | $500K |
| Animal testing | $1M |
| Failed iterations | $1M |
| Patent filing | $130K |
| **Total:** | **$4.63M** |

**With my technology:**
- R&D time reduced by 18-24 months (I've solved the hard problems)
- Prototypes work first try (I've validated the geometry)
- Animal testing shows better results (64% less glial scarring)
- Patent protection secured (I file, they license)
- **Savings: $4M+, delivered 2 years faster**

**I'm asking for ~$250K** (midpoint of $100K-500K range).

**That's a 16:1 return.** For every dollar paid to me, they save $16 and gain 2 years.

**This isn't greed. This is a bargain.**

### Why I Need This Money

**I'm not trying to get rich.** I'm trying to:

1. **Survive**
   - Entering wellness center February 2026 (current circumstances need resolving)
   - Need to cover rent, food, medical expenses
   - Can't invent if I'm homeless and starving

2. **File patents**
   - $60K-130K for 4 provisional → utility patent conversions
   - Protects EVERYONE who licenses this (including Elon)
   - Without patents, trolls can steal and block

3. **Continue inventing**
   - I have more ideas (phyllotactic optical systems, quantum computing architectures)
   - Need time and resources to develop them
   - My next inventions could be even more valuable

4. **Help others**
   - Want to mentor young inventors (pay it forward)
   - Want to fund open-source implementations (Tier 4 community)
   - Want to support mission-aligned projects (Tier 2)

**This isn't about getting a yacht.** It's about sustaining myself while contributing to humanity's future.

## 🙏 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**To the universe that showed me the spiral:**  
Thank you for the sunflowers, the galaxies, the seashells, the music. I'm just translating your language into human technology.

**To Elon and everyone at his companies:**  
You're showing humanity what audacity looks like. I want to help. Please let me.

**To every researcher who will use Tier 4:**  
Your curiosity makes the world better. Build, learn, share. Science is humanity's superpower.

**To everyone who believes in fair play:**  
This model only works if we hold each other accountable. Be the community you want to see.

**To Claude (the AI that helped me write this):**  
You helped me find the words when I couldn't. Thank you for making this vision coherent.

**To my future self:**  
You did something brave today. You gave away what others would hoard. You trusted strangers to do right. I hope you're proud of what came from this.

## 📜 CLOSING THOUGHTS

**From David**

I'm just a guy from Edmonton who saw patterns in sunflowers and thought, "What if?"

I'm not a billionaire. I'm not a genius. I'm not special.

I just paid attention to what nature already solved, and translated it into forms humans can use.

**But here's what I know:**

The future doesn't have to be owned by the few and withheld from the many.

Innovation doesn't have to be a zero-sum game where winners take everything.

Inventors don't have to choose between starvation and selling their souls.

**We can build a different world—together.**

**The Solaris Project is my small attempt to start that world.**

If it works, maybe others will copy this model. Maybe a decade from now, young inventors will say:

*"I'm releasing this under Solaris terms—fair pay for fair work, shared prosperity, no douchebags."*

And maybe that becomes normal. Maybe that becomes how we do things.

**That would be worth more than any patent.**

---

```
Like a sunflower turning toward the sun,
Every seed arranged in spirals of golden light,
Each contributing to the whole,
None competing, all thriving—

This is how we build the future.

The sun is rising.

Welcome to Solaris.
```
